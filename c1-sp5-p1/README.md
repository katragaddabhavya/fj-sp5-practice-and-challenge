# PpenJDK11InputNumber_boilerplate
Introduces reading input number using Scanner class

PS: Code in the editor gets automatically saved (but not committed) before you run any command, hence do not worry about saving the file

#### Working instructions
- Click the file ReadInputNumber.java (file name is case sensitive) and observe the various parts of the program and understand how Scanner class is imported and used
- Click on `BUILD & RUN` button, which displays command buttons and fields to enter commad line argumetns
- Compile Java program by passing ReadInputNumber.java as the command line argument and click on Compile, which should silently compile (no output will be printed)
- From where you can see the command buttons, you should also see a text area to pass inputs to STDIN, it is where you pass inputs to your program. Enter two lines of strings in the textarea
- Now run Java program by passing class name ReadInputNumber (class name is case sensitive) as the command line argument and passing the input as above mentioned and clicking on Run button, which executes your program and prints the string on the standard output
- Similarly try taking more lines and try programming, you have to compile the program each time you make code change

PS: Do not forget to commit the code bfore you leave the editor, to ensure all your changes are saved permenantly
